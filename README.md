This project is a modeled like a recipe website with an index linking to 3 different recipes with each including a picture and unordered list of ingredients an ordered list of steps

This project has helped me learn:
1.) When and How to use ordered and unordered lists
2.) The use of diferent headings in the context of a real static webpage
3.) How to embed images and organise my work
4.) How to use Git in a real project and flush out my workflow
